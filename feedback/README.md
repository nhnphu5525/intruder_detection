# FEEDBACKS FOR NX  
## 1. The process of converting the model to fit the NX system  
- There is no clear guidance on the website.  
- The packets and software used in the guide are quite outdated, causing software conflicts.  
- The supporting files for conversion on GitHub made the process easier, but more detailed guidance is needed (however, the update was made close to the submission deadline, so the team did not have enough time to handle it).  
## 2. The process of using NX  
- After successful conversion, the model was recognized by the web management features, but it does not run on NX. Reason: the model is corrupted, even though the inputs and outputs are appropriate, the conversion process caused the model to break.  
- NX also lacks detailed guidance for plugin support.  
- The language used to support plugins is C++, it would be better if there was a layer to support conversion from other languages like Python.
- The instructions on the website are incorrect. Using the conversion file from GitHub produces the correct result and is recognized by the web management system. Additionally, the website does not provide a link to GitHub.
